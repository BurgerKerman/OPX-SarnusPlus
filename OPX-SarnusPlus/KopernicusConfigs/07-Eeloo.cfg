            %description = The third major moon of Sarnus, Eeloo is a fairly standard ball of rock and ice, its surface cracked by tidal interactions between Sarnus and its sister moon of Slate. While once theorized to have a subglacial ocean, scientists now agree that this makes more sense for Encethys, leaving Eeloo to be much more boring than it was initially thought to be.
