		Vizak = ITS A UFO! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK! What's that? Moon? Sarnus is right there? Oh. Uhhh. I'll call it... Vizak. Yes. Definitely not a keysmash.
    Ryla = Stop putting lentils in front of my telescope.
    Masmar = This little guy whizzing around beyond Sarnus' rings must have suffered a beating in its youth, with that giant crater.
    Encethys = This thing is way too bright. Our telescopes are failing to pick out any detail on its surface. Definitely made of ice, though.
    Hypo = Who put this pumice stone in space? I don't think that's where it goes. 
    Phabus = Wow, I'm lucky I found this thing! It really is way out there from the rest of the moon system, I sure hope there isn't anything related to an alien molecule.
